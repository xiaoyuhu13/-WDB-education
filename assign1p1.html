    <p>Diego Brando is a genius British jockey, hailed as one of the best contenders to win the Steel Ball Run race. However, he eventually shifts his attention to gathering the Saint's Corpse for President Funny Valentine instead, after becoming aware of the race's true purpose. Diego becomes a long-standing rival of Gyro and Johnny throughout the Steel Ball Run, and although he teams up with many different individuals throughout the part, in the end, Diego is only ever truly loyal to himself.</p>
    <p>After obtaining the Left Eye of the Corpse while under the control of Dr. Ferdinand's Stand, Scary Monsters, Diego acquires his own independent version of the same Stand which remained after Dr. Ferdinand's own death.</p>

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>Diego is a young man of below-average height and slim to medium build. He has golden blond hair, dark eyebrows, and light, sharp eyes.</p>
    <p>He commonly wears an equestrian helmetW with the letters "DIO" loosely mounted on bending pins emerging from a small ribbon tied at its front, a turtleneck jumper patterned with a diagonal grid, light, mid-forearm-length gloves, light, wide-legged breeches, and tall, dark riding boots.</p>
    <p>After obtaining the Corpse's left eye and fusing it with his own, his left eye's iris has the word "TURBO" engraved on it, and he temporarily gains a mark under said eye reading "DIO", contrasting to the cross Gyro gains from the right eye.</p>
